# StockBot
Let's learn about stocks!

A stock trading bot that uses the Alpaca API to buy and sell stocks. 
It decides what to buy and sell using a Neural Network trained on 20 years worth of minute by minute data on over 2000 companies available on NASDAQ. 
I learned that prices aren't enough. 
To be truly succesful overtime it would require sentiment analysis, forum scraping, the ability to watch the news, and a slew of other features. However, this was my first Neural Network written completely from scratch and was a wonderful and infuriating learning experience.


USAGE : 
-------------------------------------------
after installing your preferred version of python
open command prompt and type "pip install alpaca-trade-api" then hit enter, that should be all you need to run the Example script
in command prompt navigate to folder directory ("cd yourDirectoryHere" + enter) and type "python Example.py" then hit enter to watch it go!
